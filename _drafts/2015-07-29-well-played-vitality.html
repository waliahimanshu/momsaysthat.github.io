<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br /><div style="font-family: -apple-system-font; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">Since last one year, we had been getting two free movie tickets each week from Vitality health insurance which of-course most of the time went unused. But when this year, when we renewed the insurance, Vitality came up with a new plan - They introduced this concept of earning 10 points through physical exercise in order yo avail the tickets each week. Shouldn’t have had been a problem since Him and I both are quite active.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: -apple-system-font; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: -apple-system-font; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">So this fine weekend, we decided to avail the point to go and watch&nbsp;<i>Bajrangi&nbsp;Bhaijaan.&nbsp;</i>When we checked my points - I had only 5 of them which meant one of us either had to buy the ticket or had to run and earn the points. So, Him decided to go out for a run - what he did’t know was he had to run only 3 miles. So in order to make sure that he gets the free ticket, he ran 10 miles! yes - 10 miles! Although, I must say I am impressed with his speed, since he managed to run 10 miles in 50 minutes.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: -apple-system-font; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: -apple-system-font; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">When he came back home from the run and checked the point status - He alone had 15 points! All came out of his mouth was - Oh! I ran a bit too much.</div><div style="font-family: -apple-system-font; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: -apple-system-font; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">So dear Vitality, I am not really sure about your plan to get us moving because -&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: -apple-system-font; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">a. Not everyone is sitting on couch, and some of us exercise regularly just not the way your app could keep a track of.</div><div style="font-family: -apple-system-font; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">b. Your mobile app sucks, BIGTIME.</div><div style="font-family: -apple-system-font; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: -apple-system-font; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">Lastly, well played Vitality. Well played.</div></div>
