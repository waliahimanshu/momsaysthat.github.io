<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">First things first! I started this book in 2014 and finished in 2015, so I'm confused whether to add it in the list of 50 or not. I might keep it on hold. Just in case I am not able to reach the goal of 50, I'll add it in this year's reads. Fair enough? Now coming back to the book. <i>Lowland</i> is written by Jhumpa Lahiri, famous from the '<i>Interpreter of Maladies</i>'. I haven't read any of her work before, so didn't have much of an expectation.<br /><div><br /><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4qh7tShW1pw/VLEx3ReqhqI/AAAAAAAAA_A/cX6Q7S0jJKg/s640/blogger-image-1372787521.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4qh7tShW1pw/VLEx3ReqhqI/AAAAAAAAA_A/cX6Q7S0jJKg/s640/blogger-image-1372787521.jpg" /></a></div><div><br /><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><i style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">The Lowland</i><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"> is set up in West Bengal, after independence, then Calcutta. It is a story of two brothers who live for each other, the elder one being an introvert and younger one an extrovert. I wouldn't reveal the plot here so summing up it,s their journey from being best friends to choosing different paths in life to connecting in a way they would've never imagined. It involves the story of the women in their life - mother, wife, daughter.&nbsp;</span></div></div><div><br /></div><div>I am reluctant to recommend this book, as I found myself loosing connection with the characters midway through it. While the starting and end of the book are quite interesting, I found myself<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;lost in the book. At times I wanted to skip the journey of <i>Gauri</i> (the wife) because of lack of connection, And on the other hand I wanted a better ending. Overall, I wasn't satisfied as a reader.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">That's that. Currently I am reading <i>The Cuckoo's Calling</i>. I have to say that I wasn't keen to start this one, but I am hooked. Can't wait to finish it!&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">How's winter treating everyone? London is behaving rather quite nice, and we are hoping it stays the same. I have already started planning travel for this year, and we can expect some beautiful destinations up on the blog this year!!&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Have a lovely weekend everyone.&nbsp;</span></div></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">*image courtesy: Google*</div></div></div>
