I am a FAN of John Green. After Shahid Kapoor, he is the man I want to meet at least once before dying! What a writer. I am sure not all of the people like his work, but a person like me who enjoys reading romantic/ light-hearted books once in a while; it is such a refreshing change. I read ‘Fault in Our Stars' when it wasn't hyped enough as a movie, and recently I got hold of his rest of the two books – An Abundance of Katherines and Will Grayson, Will Grayson. I am yet to read the latter one, but ‘An Abundance of Katherines' has left me in spellbound with John Green's work. Upon thinking, I have concluded that I liked it more than the Fault in Our Stars. It leaves you with smile on your face.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">It's a story of an extraordinarily intelligent 17 year old boy, Colin who calls himself a prodigy. He has been dumped by 19 Katherines till date, and after the latest break-up he thinks of inventing a formula which could depict that relationship beforehand. Dumper-dumpee relationship. The mathematical formulas do not restrain you from reading the book. I would hugely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading books. It's a refreshing change for regular readers, and a light book for occasional ones.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">P.S. I have already started his third book – Will Grayson, Will Grayson. If I like this one as well, I am getting a John Green tattoo. JK. *not</div></div></div>
