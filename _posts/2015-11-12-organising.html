<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">It was Diwali yesterday. As much as I hate to be away from my family around this time of the year, I also love how I get to experience the festivities of both sides of the world. You see, I have been in festive mode since the beginning of October - first with the Navratras, then the Dushera, Karva Chauth, and Diwali. Ideally, I would have calmed my horses by now but since I am in London - my excitement is still the same for Black Friday Sale, Christmas, Boxing Day, and the New Years. So yea, if you think of it, it's not that bad at all.<br /><br />October was the month of cleaning and organising. In India, everybody begins to declutter their houses around this time of the year. So that's what I did. I began with asking for help from Him which clearly didn't go as per the plan.<br /><br /><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-version="5" style="background: #FFF; border-radius: 3px; border: 0; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: -webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width: 99.375%; width: calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding: 8px;"><div style="background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50.0% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;"><div style="background: url(data:image/png; display: block; height: 44px; margin: 0 auto -44px; position: relative; top: -22px; width: 44px;"></div></div><div style="margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;"><a href="https://instagram.com/p/9ONk0eLPxG/" style="color: black; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;" target="_blank">All I said was, "help me declutter the house." #noideawhatheheard #ineedthisineedthat #ohwow #dontthrowitaway</a></div><div style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;">A photo posted by Sameera (@sameera_sood) on <time datetime="2015-10-24T13:30:03+00:00" style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">Oct 24, 2015 at 6:30am PDT</time></div></div></blockquote><script async="" defer="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script><br /><br />Then came the rounds of Laundrette for curtain cleanings, and all that glamorous stuff. Not going to bore you with that. What I do want to share with everyone is a DIY that I did to organise my kitchen. Apologies, if I sound like a middle-class penny saver, but that's what I am. :P<br /><br />I have been reusing emptied mason jars from pickles/ jams/ chutneys/ to put my spices in. What nagged my OCD to death was their lid covers. Yea, since they all had different lid covers, I couldn't deal with it anymore. Long story short, I spray painted the lids gold, and OH MY GOD! They look beautiful. (As petty as it may sound, I am in LOVE with gold spray paint).<br /><br />Next was to label them. I had to label them because of Him because once I had a bad tummy ache, and my dear husband fetched me cumin seeds instead of Carom Seeds because clearly he couldn't see a difference. I got chalk board stickers, which are again REUSABLE, and you can wipe off the chalk paint from them easily.<br /><br /><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-version="5" style="background: #FFF; border-radius: 3px; border: 0; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: -webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width: 99.375%; width: calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding: 8px;"><div style="background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 62.5% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;"><div style="background: url(data:image/png; display: block; height: 44px; margin: 0 auto -44px; position: relative; top: -22px; width: 44px;"></div></div><div style="margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;"><a href="https://instagram.com/p/9tX1A4rP4D/" style="color: black; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;" target="_blank">Taking organisation to the next level. ðŸ˜„ #upcycling #diy #goldspraypainteverything</a></div><div style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;">A photo posted by Sameera (@sameera_sood) on <time datetime="2015-11-05T15:56:06+00:00" style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">Nov 5, 2015 at 7:56am PST</time></div></div></blockquote><script async="" defer="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script><br /><br />I am sorry if it wasn't a fun blog post. I had to share it so that someone might get an organising kick out of it ( I am way too optimistic).<br /><br />Hope everyone had a lovely and safe diwali! Please do let me know in case you have an easy DIY which might be fun to do :D<br /><br />Sameera x</div>
