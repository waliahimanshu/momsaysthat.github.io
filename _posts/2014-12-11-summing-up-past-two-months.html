<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;">Starting off with the obligatory ‘Sorry for being MIA’</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;">I last updated the blog in September and I was in India the complete October (AFTER ALMOST 2 YEARS). I had so much to write about that in the end I didn’t document anything. This is one of those ideal cases of procrastination. Moving on, we were in India for a month celebrating the entire festive season. Now, I love India and I am one of those who bash the NRIs cribbing about Indian weather and cleanliness issues. I am so disappointed to say that I had turned into one of those this trip. I went ill the day we reached India, having fever as high as 104 degree C, and a sour throat for literally the WHOLE effing MONTH! I do not suffer from health issues (even minor) at all. Him has always been impressed by my immune system, as he can’t count a single time in these two years of married life when I fell sick. So this fell as a hard one on him as well.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pGQZPWLu4C8/VIm2SqCJZkI/AAAAAAAAA90/ONuIPmmlce4/s1600/10402714_10152313719695666_3507745184246993423_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pGQZPWLu4C8/VIm2SqCJZkI/AAAAAAAAA90/ONuIPmmlce4/s1600/10402714_10152313719695666_3507745184246993423_n.jpg" height="295" width="400" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;">I have missed mentioning Karva Chauth, Diwali, and my birthday here. Skipping the former ones, I’ll just write down about the birthday this year. I turned 27 this 3<sup>rd</sup>. Getting older doesn't scare me, and I have moved past the phase of being overexcited for the birthdays. We went on for our usual routines, off to work, and ended the day with watching a musical theatre and quite cozy dinner. I had been longing to watch WICKED since forever, I think may be since the day I first saw its poster when I moved to London. It was such a surreal experience, and I get it now why people prefer theatre performances over movies here. It is beyond explainable. I am a being fantasy buff, from Enchanted to Timothy Green, so there wasn’t any chance I won’t like this one. I would highly recommend watching this one. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1z9DbVjRCCw/VIm2n-euzzI/AAAAAAAAA98/USkRGLijB-U/s1600/11IN_TH_MALALA__1615325e.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1z9DbVjRCCw/VIm2n-euzzI/AAAAAAAAA98/USkRGLijB-U/s1600/11IN_TH_MALALA__1615325e.jpg" height="400" width="301" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;">While coming back from India, I have brought a whole lot of books with me because let’s face it – books are cheaper in India. I have stocked the entire pile to read for at least next 6 months. Currently reading – <i>Malala’s</i> biography – <i>I am Malala</i>, and I am hooked! You know, how I mentioned in the review of ‘A thousand Splendid Suns’ that I felt lucky while reading the book. Well, Malala tells you that indeed you are lucky and you can’t be thankful enough! I know a thousand of people have already written about her – but I have to! Her courage amazes me! Her father is the hero in her life, and how he has been there to guide her, and to be with her on the path father-daughter chose together!</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;">Next on my agenda – <i>The Lowland by Jhumpa Lehri.</i> </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><i><br /></i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;">Another thing worth mentioning here is Him’s latest addiction! Him has joined the ‘ASOS Fan Club’ bandwagon. He has picked up this habit to place an order every alternate day on ASOS, try the clothes, choose the best ones and pack the others for return. Result – I am the one visiting the ‘collect+’ store twice a week on my way to work! This better needs to stop. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-awyenpIb6WM/VIm2tINVmuI/AAAAAAAAA-E/uh0-YQVWm7M/s1600/10844816_796416830397139_251358632_o.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-awyenpIb6WM/VIm2tINVmuI/AAAAAAAAA-E/uh0-YQVWm7M/s1600/10844816_796416830397139_251358632_o.jpg" height="300" width="400" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;">Lastly, the <i>chrismasified</i>London! &nbsp;London is at its best in December. I’ve been lucky this year to enjoy festive season back home, and be back to London at the right time when the festivity had just begun! It couldn’t have been prettier, and I feel lucky every time I look at those gorgeous street decorations in Covent Garden and Oxford Street. &nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">             </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;">Will be back soon!</div></div>
