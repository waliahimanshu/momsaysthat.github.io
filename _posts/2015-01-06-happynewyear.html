Him went ill on 31</span><sup style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">st</sup><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">, and we decided to tuck in bed and watch fireworks at home. We went for London Eye fireworks last year, and had no plans to revisit the chaos this year, hence watching fireworks on TV seemed like a better option. I can’t say enough of this – I have no idea where did 2014 just go by! It seems like yesterday. It’s 6 days into the New Year, and I don’t find it any different from the earlier one honestly. New Year comes with the whole baggage of deciding upon the resolutions, and we (Him and I) are no exceptions. Each year we decide on some small targets, which we are hopeful to stick on. In 27 new years of my life, I have realised that I cannot accomplish heavy resolution goals, so since last few years I have started to come up with small goals which are realistic and achievable.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Last year, I posted my <a href="http://momsaysthat.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/first-post.html"><span style="color: blue;">resolutions</span></a>, and it’s that time of the year again. Posting them on the blog gives me motivation to stick to them and put (a tad bit) effort to complete them. I am not going to list all of them here, but naming a few:<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">This year, again, I will survive 31 days without sugar. I started this one last year, by getting motivated from Tanvi (from </span><a href="http://www.tanvii.com/" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">Tanvii.com</span></a><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">). This does not include natural sugar from fruits, etc. this one is relatively easy for me, considering I don not have a sweet tooth. I do not crave cakes, chocolates, ice creams, desserts, almost ever.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">I have also committed to myself, to read at least 50 books this year. I am an avid reader, so I will (hopefully) achieve this one as well.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">I will volunteer at charities, at least once in two months. As I have mentioned a lot of times here, I work with a charity organisation, and since the time I have joined here, I have realised how much helpful it can be for a charity to get a helping hand. Added bonus – it feels great!</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Lastly, I will take blogging more seriously. On an average, I have posted almost two posts per month last year and that IS disappointing. Among the lot, this one is the most challenging for me because of my procrastination. There are times when I have a post ready in my head, but the lack of will to go and type, keeps me at bay. Hopefully, not this year!</span></li></ul><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">P.S.
