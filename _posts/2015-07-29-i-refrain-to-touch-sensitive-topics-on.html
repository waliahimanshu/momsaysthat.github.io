<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="MsoNormal">I refrain to touch sensitive topics on the blog, generally because I do not want to get into an argument or want to sound rude here. Although, there is one topic that has been on my mind since forever! I have wanted to pour it all here, but clasped my hands to avoid doing so. It is the assumptions regarding the ‘English Language’ knowledge of us Indians. I have been working as a writer since a pretty long time now, more than 5 years actually – how time flies! *That would need another post*. I moved here to London when I had an experience of 3 years, and at that time I had no idea about the assumptions people have about Indians’ (or any immigrant, coming from a country which has English as a second language, for that matter) knowledge regarding English language.<br /><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pIL2drNKkls/VbjaYbo_VJI/AAAAAAAABGI/KEqe3oLMgBI/s1600/Untitled.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" border="0" height="343" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pIL2drNKkls/VbjaYbo_VJI/AAAAAAAABGI/KEqe3oLMgBI/s400/Untitled.png" title="@MomSaystThat" width="400" /></a></div></div><div class="MsoNormal">First of all, I agree English is the common language to communicate and it is important to know it and learn it. But in no way, I would ever agree that a person who doesn’t know the language is any less than the one that does. I hope this makes sense. Anyways, when I moved here and started looking for job – The most common question asked by the job agents was, “Did you write in English in India?” Erm, isn’t that clear from my resume? Moving on, few people also asked me here – How do you know English so well? Or Did you learn English after moving to London? Or Did you find it difficult learning English while growing up as it’s not your first language? … and the list goes on. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I want to answer all those questions today here, the exact way I answered them. I am bewildered at their ignorance, and hence want to clear out the confusion.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />Dear everyone!</div><div class="MsoNormal">English is just another language for us. India is a country of languages, and we are so used to learn different languages every time we move to a different state that we hardly find it a challenge to learn a new one. We are taught English in exact same manner as anybody else in the school curriculum, and yes our first language is Hindi but that gives us an opportunity to learn another language without putting any effort. We start learning English, along with one or at times two other different languages, at the age of 3!</div><div class="MsoNormal">Over the span of first 13-15 years of our life, an average Indian student learns three different languages:</div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; text-indent: -18.0pt;"><!--[if !supportLists]-->1.<span style="font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><!--[endif]-->English</div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; text-indent: -18.0pt;"><!--[if !supportLists]-->2.<span style="font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><!--[endif]-->Hindi – Our national language</div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; text-indent: -18.0pt;"><!--[if !supportLists]-->3.<span style="font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><!--[endif]-->State language – It can be Punjabi, Marathi, Tamil, Malayalam, Bengali, etc.</div><div class="MsoNormal">That means when someone meets an Indian, chances are pretty high that he knows at least three different languages. We can easily communicate in English in our offices, schools, while catching up with friends, as much as anyone else. NO – It hasn’t ever been a problem for us to learn it, because we never thought of it that way – that WE HAVE TO LEARN IT. We are introduced to English right from the beginning, which makes us used to it exactly like everyone else in the world.</div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">… and we find it absolutely ridiculous when someone asks us that.<br /><br />Lastly, I hope this answers the questions of most of the curious minds. I agree some are genuinely curious about studies and teaching english pattern in other countries, and if that is the case - I am sure you frame your question in that manner, and not end up offending the other person.</div></div>
