<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="MsoNormal">So, I am finished reading two books after The Lowland. I wanted to mention the first one as soon as it was done, but because the other one was the series of it, I thought of better wait for it. I have just completed the Cormoran Strike series, <i>The Cuckoo’s Calling</i> and <i>The Silkworm</i>, – two books written by <i>Robert Galbraith (J.K. Rowling)</i>. If I were to write the review in one sentence, it would be – Drop everything, and go read these books!! These books are brilliantly written, well woven, and I was hooked till the last word.</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-By6w0ISNUDc/VL5RoWNHEjI/AAAAAAAAA_Q/sb7d9Mm_XiU/s1600/books.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-By6w0ISNUDc/VL5RoWNHEjI/AAAAAAAAA_Q/sb7d9Mm_XiU/s1600/books.jpg" height="393" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Image Source - Google</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Cormoran Strike series is a thriller mystery, based in London. It has two central characters, <i>Cormoran Strike</i>(the detective) and <i>Robin </i>(the assistant). I have been a <i>JK Rowling</i>fan ever since <i>Harry Potter</i> happened. I admire her for opting for the pseudo name for these books. Her writing style is simple yet gripping. I would highly recommend these books to anyone who fancies reading something light and engaging. Good news is Rowling would be coming up with 5 more books in this series!! *Happy dance*&nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">P.S. I am done with three books out of 50 this year! Currently reading - <i>Since I Don't Have You&nbsp;</i>by<i>&nbsp;Louise Candlish.<o:p></o:p></i></div></div>
