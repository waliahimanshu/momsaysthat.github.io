<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">One of the reasons which restrain me from writing a blog post is the font. Yes, font. There I said it! I haven't yet been able to figure out how to set my choice of font and size in blogger, and this is giving me nerves. Till now, I have been writing the post on word doc, and then pasting the entire content here which means I cannot easily post through the app in my phone or iPad. Silly, I know. Apart from this, my life has been going at at a very consistent pace. After the recent trip, there hasn't actually happened anything exciting. Well apart from Diljit Dosanjh retweeting my tweet. It was like THE MOMENT for me. I know, it's not a big deal, and most of the people even don't know who he is. But, trust me. He is the sexiest sardar ever!! Like EVER!!! And the Punjabi blood in me rushes at an abnormal speed, every time I see him on screen. Don't judge me.<br /><br />I need to cut my nails. I really admire girls who manage long nails. I have been trying to grow my nails lately, and epic fail!! I end up breaking the right hand ones, and the left hand nails are giving me a hard time while typing.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-N6mO5Ga1JkM/Uxn9stuOzsI/AAAAAAAAAv4/5RTvFbaZrJk/s1600/photo1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-N6mO5Ga1JkM/Uxn9stuOzsI/AAAAAAAAAv4/5RTvFbaZrJk/s1600/photo1.jpg" height="400" width="266" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>In other news, I have been trying to learn basics of photography through online tutorials. Because Him is a bad bad photographer. He just simply cannot click a nice picture. This meant I had to put a foot forward, and had to myself learn few pointers.<br /><br />Another week has gone by, where is this year flying! It's already mid March, and I can see signs of spring over Facebook and blogsphere. But alas, I live in London and here it seems like winter starts in March. It is rather the coldest and driest month. I have actually started hating this month ever since I have moved to London. Back in India, March used to be the perfect moth in North. Neither too cold, nor too hot. And the cherry on top, used to be holi. Seems like I am again drifting towards missing India mode. Better wrap it up now.<br /><br />Happy weekend everyone.&nbsp;</div>
