<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">Another food post! *Yayy me* Although, any expert cook would laugh on my naivety in cooking department. Now this is the recipe of a simple chutney. I learnt this one from my mom, long years ago. I am sure I was around 12-13 years old, when I tried making this dish. My mom is a working lady, so she hardly ever had time to prepare chutneys and pickles for us. One day upon seeing mint, I stomped my feet in front of the vegetable vendor that I had to have chutney that day. Mum told me that she'll make it only if I ll help her clean the mint and coriander leaves. That was the first time ever I tried my hands on anything in kitchen. Of course, I just helped her in cleaning leaves and tasting afterwards.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">After wedding. it has been a ritual at my home to prepare this chutney every Sunday. I just bottle it up on the weekend, and we enjoy it with most of our meals entire week. </div><br /><b>Mint Chutney</b><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hEk0sMY-c24/Uyx1oYydAeI/AAAAAAAAAyA/bwWyhgD9gvU/s1600/DSC_0019.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hEk0sMY-c24/Uyx1oYydAeI/AAAAAAAAAyA/bwWyhgD9gvU/s1600/DSC_0019.JPG" height="350" width="525" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br />Preparation time: 15 minutes<br />Cooking time: 5 minutes<br /><br /><b>Ingredients:</b><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Mint - I usually get the pack from Asda, or similar store. You can get a bunch of mint leaves. Say around 100 gms </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Coriander - Equal to the quantity of mint. Make sure that the quantity of coriander is not less than mint as it can turn the taste bitter.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Tamarind - A small portion. *Soaked in warm water for half an hour*</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Salt - As per taste, or 2 small spoons</div><div style="text-align: justify;">1 Onion </div><div style="text-align: justify;">1 spring onion</div><div style="text-align: justify;">1 green chilly. You can add more, if prefer spicy.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Cumin seeds - half tablespoon. *Roasted*</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Dry mango powder - half tablespoon</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Half lemon</div><br /><b>Procedure:</b><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">1. Remove the leaves from the stems, and wash them twice or thrice in running water.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">2. Cut onion and spring onion in broad pieces.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">3. Add the leaves, onion, spring onion and tamarind water in grinder. Grind to smooth paste.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">4. Add salt, cumin seeds, dry mango powder to the paste, and grind for few seconds again.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">5. Now shift the chutney to a clean container, and add lemon juice.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">That is it! Chutney ready. You might want to put it in a bowl or a jar, and keep it in fridge. Try consuming it within 5-6 days of preparation. If you want to keep it for longer duration, add some citric acid while adding salt, and all in step 4.<br /><br />Also, I have recently joined Blog lovin.&nbsp; </div></div> <a href="http://www.bloglovin.com/blog/11999203/?claim=byv5rdds5we">Follow my blog with Bloglovin</a>
