<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="background: white; color: #363636; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">I am in love with a number of TV series right now, right from Shameless, Cougar Town, How I met your Mother, to Game of Thorns, and Big Bang Theory. I remember when I first came to know about the concept of sitcoms. How I met your mother was the first ever series I watched, and fell in love with Barney's charm and Ted's hopeless romantic nature. It was in 2009, when I had plenty of time on my hands just after completing my engineering. After that I got busy in shaping my career, and didn't see any of the other series, though I watched each and every season of HIMYM as a loyal fan.<br /><br /><br />Now in 2013, I again had plenty of free time on my hands. After getting married, and relocating to London, and being unemployed for nearly an year, I saw many of the TV series which I am ashamed that I never saw before. Like FRIENDS!!! How could I ever miss that show. It is such a classic masterpiece. It should not be missed by anyone, whosoever. That is one show that I ll make my kids watch in their teens. With each episode, I loved it more.<br /><br />In the past 1 year, I watched all the seasons of friends TWICE!! I started shameless, and big bang theory, and cougar town. The whole concept of television is completely different in India and western world. I do not know when would the time come, when we'll be proud of our television industry. Indian television saw a change in 90s, with the launch of all those basic saas bahu sagas, but ever since it has been stagnant (apart from few good reality shows here n there). Indian television will have to grow leaps and bounds to have a respectable place in the market.<br /><br />Apart from watching the TV series, I have been trying my hands on different cuisines. I am not an excellent cook, nor have I ever tried my hands on anything difficult but being said that, I enjoy cooking. I get happy when my food is appreciated. London is getting chilly. It is still better than the February last year, when I came. I really hate the weather in February here.<br /><br />Lastly, I have to update the layout of the blog. I have completely forgotten how to add widgets through the code, or may be Blogger has changed some settings. Now this definitely on my To-do list.</span></div></div>
